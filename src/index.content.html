                <h1>Earth Day Fort Wayne to expand in 2013</h1>
                <p>
                    In just its second year, Earth Day Fort Wayne (a Little 
                    River Wetlands Project event) has become the preeminent 
                    Earth Day celebration in Northeast Indiana. Donâ€™t forget 
                    to mark your calendar to attend this popular festival on 
                    Sunday, April 21 from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. at Eagle Marsh. The 
                    first annual event was a success, drawing more than 500 
                    people, and this year is shaping up to be another fabulous 
                    event.

                    "We were thrilled with the turnout last year," says Sean 
                    Nolan, Executive Director of Little River Wetlands Project 
                    (LRWP). "I think it demonstrates that people in northeast 
                    Indiana are genuinely enthused about conservation and taking 
                    care of the planet."

                    and educational events for the entire family and is expected 
                    to draw nearly 1,500 people. We'll have public participation

                    Trail, and more.
